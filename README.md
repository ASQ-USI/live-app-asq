Project details
======
This project consists of implementing a feedback system for **[ASQ](http://asq.inf.usi.ch/)**.
It allows viewers to give an understanding, which ranges from 0 to 100, of the current presentation. It also allows viewers to pose questions/ make remarks to the presenter but also allows to rate other viewers' questions.

Another feature of *ASQ.feedback* is that the presenter is able to broadcast questions/remarks to the audience.
